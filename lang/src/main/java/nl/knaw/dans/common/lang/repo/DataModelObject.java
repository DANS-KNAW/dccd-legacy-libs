/**
 * A DataModelObject is a StorableObject that aggregates zero or more MetadataUnits and/or BinaryUnits. A
 * dmo can be in three states: not loaded, loaded and registered for deletion. Currently not loaded means
 * not stored in the repository and loaded means stored in the repository and retrieved. Registered for
 * deletion means that the status of the object has been set to deleted. A type of DataModelObject can be
 * identified via its content model and its object namespace. Each DataModelObject should have its own
 * unique object namespace as well as provide at least one unique content model. The content model allows
 * inheritance and extension, but the object namespace does not.
